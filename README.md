### How to Use  

1. Install the package by running:  
   ```sh
   npm i characterextractorstool
   ```  
2. Start the extension by running:  
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```  

Once you run the code, you should see the character data. If you want to modify the code, navigate to `src/main.ts`. This file contains the main code used for testing the app. To customize it, change the URL to your preferred one.  

For further optimization, check `src/Examples`. This folder contains various examples. However, if you want to modify the core functionality, look at `src/Extractors/Wrapper`. The wrapper files contain essential code, such as importing characters and other key operations.
